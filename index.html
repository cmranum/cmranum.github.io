<p class="Aboutme"> My name is Caleb Ranum. I am an archaeology PhD Student in the Anthropology department at the University of Alabama, focusing on foodways and plant use in the Early Iron Age of Central Europe. My specific area of research is the paleoethnobotany of the Eastern Hallstatt Kalenderberg culture, primarily in Western Slovakia. I work with Dr. Katherine Chiou in the Ancient People and Plants Laboratory (APPL) on multiple projects related to chili pepper. One project is focused on identifying different species of chili based on seed morphometrics. Another is using aDNA to identify ancient chili pepper varieties. I also work with Dr. Alan Farahani on creating a database of radiocarbon dates for early domestic animals and plants. </p>
<h1> What is Paleoethnobotany?</h1>
<p>Paleoethnobotany is a subdiscipline of the field of archaeology that investigates plant remains found at archaeological sites in order to reconstruct the relationship between past peoples and past environments.  Archaeologists attempt to reconstruct past plant use by recovering and identifying preserved plant remains from archaeological contexts. This is done by a process called floatation. Soil samples are taken at the archaeological site and are then submerged in water using a specialized tank. This allows heavy remains such as bone or ceramic to sink to the bottom while lighter plant remains float to the top. These light and heavy fractions are recovered while the soil is removed by the water. The archaeologist than looks at the fractions under a microscope; meticulously sorting each sample and separating plant remains which are then compared with reference collections in order to identify them. By identifying which plants were used, a paleoethnobotanical approach can help archaeologists understand the cuisine of past peoples, helping to reveal daily life in the past. </p>

    <h1> People and Plants of the Early Iron Age in the Middle Danube Region </h1>

    <p>My dissertation research is focused on five sites from the early Iron age in the Middle Danube Region in Central Europe. The sites are located in Slovakia, Moravia, Austria, and Hungary and primarily represent lowland settlements. This project will be one of the first studies to investigate the paleoethnobotany of the early Iron Age in Western Slovakia. It will answer questions about the natural environment, agricultural practices, and cuisine of the inhabitants of the Middle Danube Region during the early Iron Age. These investigations will also provide evidence for more general questions, such as how did past people adapt to changing environments. It will also serve as a comparison study for ongoing investigations in Eastern Slovakia by Dr. Maria Hajnalova.  </p>
